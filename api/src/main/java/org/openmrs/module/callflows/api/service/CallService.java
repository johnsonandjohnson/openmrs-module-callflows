    /**
     * Makes an outbound call using the IVR configuration to use, the flow name to kick start the call with
     * and a map of parameters
     * <p></p>
     * In the params map, three keys have special meanings
     * phone - indicating the phone number to call [REQUIRED]
     * actorId - indicating a unique ID that you can connect with your application user [OPTIONAL]
     * actorType - indicating a type of a user, say a doctor or a patient [OPTIONAL]
     * <p></p>
     * The flowName will be stored in the created call's context as a variable named jumpTo
     * Typically the IVR providers will be configured to always hit a specific main flow and while making outbound calls,
     * when you want to invoke a different flow, this parameter will be passed to the IVR provider as internal.jumpTo,
     * which one will then get in the request back.
     * The callflow designer can make use of this information to jump to this requested from from a appropriate point
     * in their main flow.
     * Eg: One can use the main flow for any authentication like entering a PIN and then jump to this flow
     * or you could jump even before the authentication, if so desired.
     * Typically only these two parameters (phone and jumpTo) along with a callId would be passed to the IVR provider's API
     * to initiate a call.
     * No other params *need to be* passed, but this is configurable in the relevant IVR's configuration section
     * These params will be passed to the IVR provider under the names internal.phone, internal.jumpId and internal.callId
     * <p></p>
     * All params passed to this method will also be persisted in the call's context,
     * so that they are available for use in the callflow.
     * Eg: If making a outbound call for a visit reminder, use
     * <code>flowName</code> for your entry flow,
     * <code>jumpTo</code> as your visit reminder flow,
     * <code>visitId</code> indicating for which visit this reminder is for,
     * that you can then use from within your callflow to retrieve the visit object and do something with it
     * <p></p>
     * Event: Sends a failed call event passing all parameters into the event in case the call could not be made for any reason
     * <p></p>
     * Note: This method was inspired and adapted from the MOTECH IVR module
     *
     * @param configName indicating the IVR configuration to use to connect to the caller
     * @param flowName   indicating the flow to execute first for the callee
     * @param params     a map of parameters containing information needed for the call to be placed
     * @return the call created
